# Andrew Allyn put these functions together. See https://github.com/aallyn/ME-NH-trawl-Seagrant/blob/95230121ed89a6425faf0fe29fbc67cdbddfa8e3/Objective%203/Code/overlap_fuctions.R#L2 for the original work. 

# Each of these functions take a data frame with X and Y locations, the abundace/biomass/presence of predator and prey. Some of these functions also require an area variable. As of writing it isn't clear to me how this value is calculated (11/1/2024).
